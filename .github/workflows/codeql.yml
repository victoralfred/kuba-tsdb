 # .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml

# Provides Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) using GitHub's CodeQL Engine.
# Scans for vulnerabilities, security flaws, and common bugs.
name: "CodeQL Analysis"
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
